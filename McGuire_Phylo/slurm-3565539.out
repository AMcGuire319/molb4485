Starting raxmlHPC run at Tue Nov 12 15:25:25 MST 2019

WARNING: The number of threads is currently set to 0
You can specify the number of threads to run via -T numberOfThreads
NumberOfThreads must be set to an integer value greater than 1

RAxML, will now set the number of threads automatically to 2 !

Warning, you specified a working directory via "-w"
Keep in mind that RAxML only accepts absolute path names, not relative ones!

RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


This is the RAxML Master Pthread

This is RAxML Worker Pthread Number: 1


This is RAxML version 8.2.12 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on May 2018.

Alignment has 192 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.00%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 50 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 192
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR
